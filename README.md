### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/dannnshe/csbc1030_Assignment3.git]
   cd [csbc1030_Assignment3]
   ```

2. **Running the Script**

   Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   This will execute the script `app.js`, which reads the data from `sample_input_numbers.json`, doubles each number, and writes the results to `sample_output_numbers.json` in the `samples` directory.

## File Descriptions

- `app.js`: The main Node.js script file that contains the logic for reading, processing, and writing data.
- `samples/sample_input_numbers.json`: Sample input file containing an array of numbers.
- `samples/sample_output_numbers.json`: The script generates this file with processed output.
